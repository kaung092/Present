<!-- Call the JW Player JavaScript file, jwplayer.js. 
Replace WEB-DISTRIBUTION-DOMAIN-NAME with the domain name of your 
CloudFront web distribution, for example, d1234.cloudfront.net 
(begins with "d"). This causes a browser to download the JW Player file 
before streaming begins.

<H1>This video is streamed by CloudFront and played by JW Player 6.</H1>

<!-- Replace RTMP-DISTRIBUTION-DOMAIN-NAME with the domain name of your 
RTMP distribution, for example, s5678.cloudfront.net (begins with "s").

Replace VIDEO-FILE-NAME with the name of your .mp4 or .flv video file, 
including the .mp4 or .flv filename extension. For example, if you uploaded 
my-vacation.mp4, enter my-vacation.mp4. You might need to prepend "mp4:" to the 
name of your video file, for example, mp4:my-vacation.mp4.
