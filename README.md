This HopHacks Spring 2016 Hackathon project allows users to practice their presentation in virtual reality.

Users can upload their powerpoint presentation and practice their speech (using oculus rift) in virtual reality environment where they can see
simulated audience as well as their presentation slides. At the same time the web camera will be recording user so that they can review their body languages after their practice.

The web application (1) takes the power point slide uploaded by user, (2) converted each slide into images and merge them into 360' virtual reality image, 
(3) Record user with web cam when user entered any key
